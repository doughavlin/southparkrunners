Raising lactate threshold enables one to race faster/further before fatigue sets in. They are called cruise-intervals(popularized by running coach Jack Daniels). Benefits are similar to tempo runs. Don't turn your threshold-pace workouts into competitive efforts;  *threshold-pace should feel comfortably hard (10K pace + 15-20 seconds)."
